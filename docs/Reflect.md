## Please reflect on this assessment and your performance

Below are reflection and performance and the main aspects related to the assignment

1. Timing, planning and design decision
- The priority on the requirements were clear, but the circumstances changed that I could afford around only 3 workdays on the assignment, instead of around 4-5 days at hoped. It was a mistake not to estimate with a buffer for this. This resulted in deprioritizing some parts of the requirements.

- The design decision to choose something new (Service Fabric) made it a bit more difficult, but I glad I made it through and learned a new application platform

2. Performance
- Delivery first: the solution doesn't have value if it's not delivered, so I made sure the other as aspects: clients, CI/CD, access are covered sufficiently
- System design: it's not entirely standard, e.g. one could argue the Message and Group can be stored in reliable collections in a stateful service. Still, in my opinion the approach is sufficient and easy to understand and extend
- Code quality: I planned for a code review and static code analysis but did not find time for it. At least static code analysis could be added from the beginning
